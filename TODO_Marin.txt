TODOS:

Implement MDS with couplings.
Check out my diff-dim-sam-spectra thing..

How to communicate data: Hamiltonians, ect.
-What data do I need?
-I need a code that takes a Hamiltonian and estiamtes dimension, then we can try multiple cost functions quickly to get results quick.
-Whats with starting with a Hamiltonian. Why is there a focuse on the coste function. How does one go frmo H to dimension estimate.



-Describe in details what I am doing:
Starting point: a Hamilotnian or coupling strengths. 
Since Nicolas has a way to go from H to couplings, I can just take the couplings.
-Do I need a state to do MDS? Since I have teh couplings I dont think so... Yea, we dont, a state defines a graph in the context of Charles's paper, but here our Hamilotnian defines a graph.
-Start by getting a graph? from the Jab. We have 5 tables of Jab for the diff kind of interactions. We start by focusing just on the Jab of the zz interactions.
-Potential issue. How do I mix the 5 diff interaction kinds... 
-Potential issue: each point is connected to each point for a generic Hamiltonian. Maybe I need to define a cuttoff?
-The metric is defined by a a distance defined by summing over a path between 2 vertices. So 2 vertices connected by with each other directly might have a shorted path by passing "around" this simple connection.
